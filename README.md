# Welcome to my personal website portfolio

This is one of a _mandatory_ assignments as a student **RevoU**.
Kindly refer to the below deployed **link** for the grading purposes.

## Overview

This is a simple **personal portfolio website** created to showcase my projects
as well as some of my _personal_ information.
It is built with html and simple CSS styling for an attractive and responsive design.

Through this assignment I learn how to build a website using HTML code and some simple CSS style code.
And I think this is a **good start** for me as a beginner in a software engineer.

## Features Implemented

As I menitoned before in the overview section, I devided the html files into 4 pages, following are the 
features implemented.

1. Home - Website introduction and purpose
2. About Me - Get to know me more, such as my experiences as well as my interests
3. My Projects - Projects or tasks I have made
4. Contact me - Way to reach me out and get my personal CV

## Technologies Used

There are only 2 technologies I used in this project at the moment:
- HTML - for the semantic structure page
- CSS  - for the styling and layout
- VSCode - for the main developer

I hope that I could implement more technologies in my website in the future
